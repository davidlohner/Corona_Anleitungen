## Quick guide 

1. Launch PowerPoint.
2. Open your slides.
3. Switch to the "Slide Show" tab.
4. Click on "Record presentation".
    * If you are working with a Windows computer or laptop, you have the possibility to switch on the webcam during a recording as well. This option can be switched off.
5. Give your lecture as usual. The recording will end when you end the presentation as well.
6. Save the recording of the presentation under "File" - "Save as" or "Export" as video in **.mp4** format.
7. Check the recorded video:
    * Is your voice good to hear and to understand?
    * Are all slides discussed and are there no long gaps?

If you are not satisfied with one of the aspects, correct the corresponding spots and perform a new test recording. You may have to ask your ITB or administrator for help to optimize your setup (e.g. the microphone settings).


## Some tips
* Don’t record a 90-minute lecture all at once! Divide the recordings into **smaller sections of about 10-20 minutes**. This way you can reassemble each time, take breaks and don't have to re-record everything if you make mistakes.
* If possible you should speak **freely and not too quietly**. Imagine that the students are sitting in front of you: Use direct speech and avoid long and complex sentences.
:::danger
* During slide transitions that have a certain duration assigned, **no sound** is recorded.
* During a presentation recording in the slides, **jumping back does not work**.
:::
:::success
* After recording, you can re-record individual slides to correct minor errors. For instructions, please refer to the official Microsoft support documents (see below).
:::
* Name the video files on your computer according to a uniform nomenclature and organize them in a well thought-out folder structure. This will help you to find and provide the individual learning units more easily later.
