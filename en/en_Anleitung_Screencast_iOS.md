## Quick guide
1. Enable direct access to the screen recording function from the Control Center under iOS:
    * Open System Preferences.
    * Select "Control Center" and then "Customize Controls".
    * Tap the plus icon next to "Screen capture".
2. Open the control panel.
3. Tap and hold the recording icon.
4. Activate the microphone for recording.
5. Start recording.

:::info
In this way, _everything_ you see on your display is also saved in the video, and your device's microphone is also active, so you can discuss the content shown.
This allows you to show presentations, access web pages, draw digitally or take digital handwritten notes or demonstrate special apps.

6. End the recording by tapping on the red icon in the status bar at the top of the screen, the video will automatically be saved in the photo app.
7. Check the recorded video:
    * Is your voice good to hear and to understand?
    * Are there any unwanted elements for the video (e.g. personal data or notifications)?

If you are not satisfied with one of the aspects, correct your settings accordingly and carry out a new test recording.

8. After recording, transfer the recordings from your smartphone to your computer. You can then compress the file before uploading it to speed up the upload. There are separate instructions for this.

## Some tips
* Place your iPhone or iPad slightly tilted on a firm surface so that it does not wobble during recording due to operation, otherwise noise can easily occur!
* Don’t record a 90-minute lecture all at once! Divide the recordings into **smaller sections of about 10-20 minutes**. This way you can collect yourself anew each time, take breaks and do not have to re-record everything if you make mistakes.
* You should speak free and not too softly if possible. Imagine that the students are sitting opposite you: Use a direct approach and avoid long and complex sentences.
* Name the video files on your computer according to a uniform nomenclature and organize them in a well thought-out folder structure. This will help you to find and provide the individual learning units more easily later.


## Apple support
If you have trouble finding the recording feature on your device, Apple's official support site can help you:

* How to prepare your recordings for uploading and create the smallest possible files with the same quality is shown in this guide: [Video Compression Guide](https://s.kit.edu/tutorial-videokomprimierung).
* How to make the recordings available to your students via ILIAS is explained in a separate manual.
