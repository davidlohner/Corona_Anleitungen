# Cut and trim videos with Avidemux (Windows/Linux)
Often you have unwanted sequences at the beginning or end of a self-produced video by switching the camera on and off. Often you want to remove a sequence from the video quickly. Avidemux offers Linux and Windows users a quick and easy way to shorten and cut.

## Required equipment
* Computer with Linux or Windows
* The editing program Avidemux -> [Download](https://www.heise.de/download/product/avidemux-27035/download)
* Your teaching content in **a** video

## Guide
### Open a video
To be able to edit a video, it must first be imported into the program, of course.
To do this, click "open" in the "File" menu. In the new window select the desired video from your hard drive.

### Cut off the beginning
To remove unwanted sequences at the beginning of the video, move the slider on the timeline to the point where you want the video to start.
Now the front part can be separated with the B button (B = before) and deleted with the **Delete** button.

:::warning
Attention: the backspace key does not work here, only the delete key!
:::

:::info
Tip: You can also use the arrow keys on the keyboard or the arrow buttons under the timeline. You can use the double arrows to fast-forward or rewind faster.
:::


### Remove the end
To remove unwanted sequences at the end of the video, position the Timeline slider where you want the video to end.
Now press the A button (A = after). Now everything up to the end is marked and can be deleted with the delete button.

### Cut a sequence out in the middle of the video
To cut in the middle of the video, the slider must first be set to the beginning of the sequence to be removed.
Then press the A Button.
Now move the slider to the point **to** where you want to remove everything.
Then press the B button.
The area in between is now automatically marked and can be deleted with **Remove**.

### Save the video
On the left side there are several possibilities to make presettings. Select MP4 or MP4v2 (Muxer) for the output format.
To save the video as Mp4, go to the "File" menu and click "Save".
Select a location in the new window and name the video. Press "OK". You will receive a notification about the successful saving process.

Use the MP4v2 format as it is compatible with most players.

## Notes
Avidemux is a simple program to cut sequences from videos or to shorten the beginning and end. You cannot move the sequences, swap the order or even insert a video clip into the video.
If you want to do that, please refer to the related links.

There are many more, but more complex programs that can be used to cut and edit videos.
* With the **Video Editor** preinstalled under Windows 10, or with the photo program from Windows, photos and video clips can be combined into _one_ video. [You can find instructions here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEyn2NYVZqw&feature=youtu.be)
    * [Or here at the official Microsoft support](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/22877/windows-10-photos )
* Corel **VideoStudio X10**: This program is available to KIT employees. [A manual can be found here](https://learn.corel.com/video-tutorials/videostudio-pro-tutorials/videostudio-x10-tutorials/)
* For Linux users (and also under Windows) videos can be shortened, cut, inserted, repositioned and labeled with the program **ShotCut**.


## Next steps
* How to prepare the recordings for upload and create the smallest possible files with the same quality is shown in this guide: [Video Compression Guide](https://s.kit.edu/tutorial-videokomprimierung).
* A separate guide will show you how to make the recordings available to your students via ILIAS.
