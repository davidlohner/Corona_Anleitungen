# Attractive course room design in ILIAS
```
last update: 31.03.2020
```
ILIAS course rooms are the primary environment for the organisation and administration of your course. In order for students to find their way around easily, the course rooms should be neatly structured, visually appealing and individually designed. In this way, students can determine at a glance which virtual room they are currently in.

## Concept of this manual
This manual follows a three-step approach, which is partly due to the operation of ILIAS as a Learning Management System (LMS). In a nutshell this three-step can be formulated as follows:

**1. Add all projects and materials
2. Grouping the objects
3. Arranging the contents within the course**

An exemplary course is created for this tutorial, which follows a classical session flow and provides some additional material about ILIAS.

:::danger
All objects shown in the pictures are **added exclusively for demonstration purposes**. Instructions for the (media) didactic design of purely online courses are being developed at the ZML.
:::

## Step 1: Add objects
1. Add new objects on the top level of the ILIAS course

:::warning
ILIAS adds all materials to a long list in your course and automatically orders the objects by type.

2. Assign all materials to corresponding sessions or folders.

## Step 2: Group the objects
Objects of different object types can be grouped in material lists, so-called "object blocks". 
1. Create a new object block and give it a meaningful name.

2. Insert objects related to content or organization in the object block. To do this, select the relevant objects from the list.

ILIAS now shows you a list of your materials sorted by object blocks.

:::info
Object blocks are particularly useful if you want to group different object types. In a later step, you can group all objects of a type (e.g. sessions) under "Material lists", in addition to object blocks.

## Design of the course page

In order for your students to find their way around your ILIAS course quickly and easily, you should arrange the object blocks you have created on the page of your course.

### Preliminary remark
Basically, you design a website on which your course content is stored. Therefore it is helpful to take borrowings from web design for the design.

### Column layout
An important feature of good design is an underlying grid. In ILIAS you can use a column layout that divides the contents of your course into **twelve equal-sized columns**. ILIAS offers you the possibility to scale contents to a defined width of this basic grid and indicates these steps in twelfths:

The columns are always counted from left to right: The first column is on the far left, the last column on the far right.

### Layout for mobile devices
ILIAS optimizes the display for different display sizes (from smartphone in portrait format to large desktop). In the column layout you can determine how wide each column is displayed on the respective mobile devices. Several columns next to each other are displayed below each other on narrow devices.

## Step 3: Arranging the object blocks
1. Click on "Design page".

2. Click on the plus and select "Insert column layout".

3. Now create a column layout that makes sense for your content.

4. On the page you can insert content into the individual columns.

5. Insert your created object blocks into the respective columns under the entry "Material lists".

* You can also add all objects of one type (e.g. sessions) as one material list to a column.

6. Insert further blocks for text modules (e.g. headings, short paragraphs) at the appropriate places. To do this, select "Page design" - "Insert block" and choose from the paragraph formats e.g. "Background" to get a white box around your text blocks.

7. Save text blocks and paragraphs regularly using the "Save and ..." buttons at the top of the editor.

**tips**
Blocks can have additional functions:
* For example, the block "Advanced Knowledge" can be hidden and shown again by students on your course page with a single click.
* You can already create blocks but "deactivate" them and only make them visible (activate) when needed.
* Blocks can be provided with dates to be automatically visible at pre-defined times or periods (e.g. for announcements or similar).

Your ILIAS page now has a clear structure.

## [ Continues ] Bonus: Eye Candy and further individualizations
To help students easily distinguish your course from other learning platforms, you can use some visual elements to customize your course.

### Own course icon
In the settings of your course you can select an adapted icon under "Display". The image format must be a "scalable vector graphic" with the extension .**svg**.

### Header image (for individual columns)
1. Add a **image**/audio/video in a column of your choice under "Design page".

2. Navigate to the settings of the uploaded image

3. Select the paragraph format "MediaContainerFull100" in the "Style" tab

# Some notes
* Important and relevant content for the students should be placed as prominently as possible, i.e. high up in the hierarchy.
* Priorities change in the course of a semester. If your course opens with a "Welcome" text paragraph, you may no longer need this section after a few weeks in the semester. For this purpose, e.g. the criteria for credits are more in demand. **Adapt your course to the current needs of your students also during the semester.**
